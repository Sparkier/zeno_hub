# Development

Zeno's backend is a Python FastAPI server.

## Development Setup

Please read the [overall development setup](../DEVELOPMENT.md) before reading this.
Then follow the steps outlined here to run the backend locally.

The backend works with a postgres database. Once set up, this database needs some tables. You can bootstrap the database using [this sript](./create_tables.sql).

Once this backend database is set up, Connex needs information on how to connect to it. therefore, add a `database.ini` in [./zeno_backend/database](./zeno_backend/database/) as follows:

```
[postgresql]
host=[whereever your DB is running]
dbname=[the name of your DB]
user=[usename for DB login]
password=[password for DB login]
```

For a debug setup, you can also run `uvicorn zeno_backend.server:get_server --reload` from within the poetry shell.

### Static Analysis Tools

Ruff (linting), black (formatting), mypy (typechecking)

### Testing

pytest

### Guidelines:

- **Use Type Annotation:** Extensive type annotation is a key way to catch bugs in Python programs.
- **Prefer Data Structures over Dicts:** Dicts are flexible but donâ€™t allow for type checking using static analysis. Instead, prefer using pydantic classes, which allows you to easily specify data structures.
- **Documentation:** All code should be documented (we will use the Google docstring standard). This will be enforced by linting.

## Deployment

To deploy the backend, you can either use the same setup as outlined for local development, or set environment variables instead of creating a `database.ini`.
You will have to set the following variables: `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD`.

Additionally, you can configure the host and port for the backend using `BACKEND_HOST` and `BACKEND_PORT`, if not set, these default to `0.0.0.0` and `80`, respectively.
The backend can be started with poetry, from within the backend folder, run: `poetry run backend`.

To make sure that your frontend can access content from this backend even if running on another origin, use the `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable to set CORS headers when requests come from the specified origin.
